### Summary
My main goal is to develop my mind and will get an interesting and well-paid job while get the necessary programming skills. I have no experience in programming, but I want to get it on this course. I became interested in programming while listening to my friends’ stories about their works. This struck me as interesting and worth attention. I chose the most interesting language for myself - Javascrip. I want to do my best to learn how to work on it.

### Skills
 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - JavaScript 
 - Visual Studio Code
 - p.s. I studied books written by authors Robson E., Freeman E.: Head First HTML, XHTML and CSS; Head First JavaScript programming: A Brain-Friendly Guide.

### Code examples
 ```
 exports.min = function min (array) {
  if (array!=undefined&&array.length!=0) return Math.min(...array);
  return 0;
}

exports.max = function max (array) {
  if (array!=undefined&&array.length!=0) return Math.max(...array);
  return 0;
}

exports.avg = function avg (array) {
  if (array!=undefined&&array.length!=0) return array.reduce((item,sum)=>sum+item,0)/array.length;
  return 0;
}

```
```

module.exports = function countCats(matrix) {
  let catArr = matrix.flat().filter(cat => cat === '^^');
  return catArr.length
};

```
