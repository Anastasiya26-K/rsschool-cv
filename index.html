                <li>My main goal is to develop my mind and will get an interesting and well-paid job 
                    while get the necessary programming skills. I have no experience 
                    in programming, but I want to get it on this course. I became interested in programming 
                    while listening to my friends’ stories about their works. This struck me as interesting and worth attention. 
                    I chose the most interesting language for myself - Javascrip. I want to do my best to learn how to work on it.</li>
                <li>
                   I studied books written by authors Robson E., Freeman E.: Head First HTML, XHTML and CSS; Head First JavaScript programming: A Brain-Friendly Guide.
                </li>
                <li>I received a master’s degree in geoecology and at this moment I work in my specialty.</li>
                <li>I intensively studied English on individual training up to B1 / B2 level, during which I was invited to participate in youth projects organized by ERASMUS +, where I gained experience in speaking.</li>
               <li>
                <p>Code example</p>
            <script>
                exports.min = function min (array) {
                    if (array!=undefined&&array.length!=0) return Math.min(...array);
                    return 0;
                   }
                   
                   exports.max = function max (array) {
                    if (array!=undefined&&array.length!=0) return Math.max(...array);
                    return 0;
                   }
                   
                   exports.avg = function avg (array) {
                    if (array!=undefined&&array.length!=0) return array.reduce((item,sum)=>sum+item,0)/array.length;
                    return 0;
                   }
                </script>
